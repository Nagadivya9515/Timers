# Digital Clock

This folder contains the implementation of the digital clock application component.

## Features  
- Displays current time in hours, minutes and seconds.  
- Likely updates every second to reflect real-time.  
- Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI for learning timer & clock functions.

## Usage  
1. Open `index.html` (or appropriate main file) in a browser.  
2. The clock will display automatically and update live.  
3. No additional setup is required.

## Code structure  
- `index.html` — main HTML page for the clock.  
- `style.css` — CSS styling for the clock UI.  
- `script.js` — JavaScript logic to update the time. 

## Notes  
- Good starting point for understanding `setInterval()` or `requestAnimationFrame()` in JS.  
- Can be extended with features like AM/PM toggle, 24-hour format switch, time zones etc.

# PlannedTimeline

This folder contains the “Planned Timeline” component of the project.

## Features  
- Probably a timeline view where tasks/events are planned over time.  
- Might include timer and display of upcoming or past items.  
- UI to help visualize scheduled items in a timeline format.

## Usage  
1. Open the relevant HTML file in this folder in a browser.  
2. Enter/choose planned items/tasks (depending on UI).  
3. View them laid out in a timeline.  
4. Use timer or countdown features if supported.

## Code structure  
- `index.html` — main interface.  
- `style.css` — styles for timeline layout.

## Notes  
- Good for turning a plain timer into something more organisational.  
- Could be enhanced with drag-and-drop, persistence (local storage), editing capabilities.

# Pomodoro App

This folder holds a Pomodoro-style timer component of the project.

## Features  
- Supports the Pomodoro Technique: work intervals (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (e.g., 5 minutes).  
- UI to start, pause, reset the timer.  
- Visual feedback when switching between work and break periods.

## Usage  
1. Navigate to the folder and open the main HTML file in browser.  
2. Click “Start” to begin the work interval.  
3. After the work interval ends, automatically (or via UI) switch to break interval.  
4. Repeat cycles as defined.  
5. Optionally reset or change durations as needed.

## Code structure  
- `index.html` — main Pomodoro timer UI.  
- `style.css` — styling for timer and interval states.  
- `script.js` — manages intervals, switching between work/break, timer countdown.  
-  UI for custom durations.

## Notes  
- Very useful for productivity and focus sessions.  
- Could be enhanced by adding notifications, sound alarms, session tracking, and logging total work time.

# Timer App

This folder is for the general timer / stopwatch component of the project.

## Features  
- A countdown timer (set time and count down to zero).  
- Possibly a stopwatch mode (count up from zero).  
- Controls for Start, Pause, Reset.  
- Visual display of minutes, seconds (and maybe hours).

## Usage  
1. Open the HTML file in this folder in a browser.  
2. Input the desired time (if applicable) or switch to stopwatch mode.  
3. Press “Start” to begin timing.  
4. Use “Pause” to halt the timer, “Reset” to clear.  
5. When time runs out (for countdown), alert/visual change may happen.

## Code structure  
- `index.html` — main timer UI.  
- `style.css` — styling for timer display and control buttons.  
- `script.js` — logic for timer countdown/up, button handlers, state management.  
-  Possibly audio alert or visual signal on completion.

## Notes  
- A fundamental piece for many timer utilities.  
- Could be extended with laps (for stopwatch), multiple timers, persistent storage, and mobile compatibility.




# Root of the Project

This is the root folder for the “Timers” project. It contains the overall project configuration and common assets.

## Contents

- `index.html` — potentially a landing page combining or linking to all components.  
- `style.css`, `style-2.css` — global or alternative styles for the project.  
- Other root files as needed (license, images, etc.).

## About the Project  
This project contains multiple timer/clock utilities including:  
- A Digital Clock  
- A Planned Timeline tool  
- A Pomodoro Timer  
- A General Timer/Stopwatch
